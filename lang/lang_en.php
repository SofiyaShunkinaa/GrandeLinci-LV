The legend remains a legend, but the word 'Coon' (short for raccoon) has stuck with the breed."

A wide paw, protected by additional tufts of fur, is also a useful adaptation, helping to glide on icy surfaces without sinking into snow. And impressive size is an invaluable advantage in hunting small game. 

As for modern representatives of the breed, the passion of European breeders for extremization could not help but affect their appearance. Today's Maine Coons have significantly increased in size, their faces have become even more elongated, and their ears have grown considerably."

If you don't have the opportunity to take your pet out often, consider purchasing a tall play complex that can brighten up your pet's everyday life."

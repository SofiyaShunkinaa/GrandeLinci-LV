A wide paw, protected by additional tufts of fur, is also a useful adaptation, helping to glide on icy surfaces without sinking into snow. And impressive size is an invaluable advantage in hunting small game. 
<br>
As for modern representatives of the breed, the passion of European breeders for extremization could not help but affect their appearance. Today's Maine Coons have significantly increased in size, their faces have become even more elongated, and their ears have grown considerably.";}i:2;a:4:{s:4:"href";s:11:"temperament";s:8:"img_path";s:23:"/assets/images/cat5.png";s:5:"title";s:22:"Maine Coon Temperament";s:7:"content";s:422:"Maine Coons are unobtrusive cats who highly value their independence. This trait is especially pronounced in females. Animals react favorably to tactile contact, but you won't be able to knead or squeeze them.
<br>
The period of maximum physical activity for this breed is in the first five years of life. After reaching this 'respectable' age, cats start to become slightly lazy, preferring passive rest to noisy games.";}i:3;a:4:{s:4:"href";s:6:"health";s:8:"img_path";s:23:"/assets/images/cat6.png";s:5:"title";s:19:"Health and Diseases";s:7:"content";s:272:"Among the specific diseases that Coons are susceptible to, breeders highlight abscesses, bald spots, alopecia, and dried-out skin.

However, breeders claim that with proper care from the owner, cats of this breed can adapt well even in a city apartment. And excursions to meadows and forests can easily be replaced by regular walks on a leash.
